	<Verse VerseID="7"><![CDATA[He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days - and His Throne was over the waters - that He might try you, which of you is best in conduct.

	<Verse VerseID="8"><![CDATA[If We delay the penalty for them for a definite term, they are sure to say, "What keeps it back?" Ah! On the day it (actually) reaches them, nothing will turn it away from them, and they will be completely encircled by that which they used to mock at!]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="17"><![CDATA[Can they be (like) those who accept a Clear (Sign) from their Lord, and whom a witness from Himself doth teach, as did the Book of Moses before it,- a guide and a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it,- the Fire will be their promised meeting-place.

	<Verse VerseID="27"><![CDATA[But the chiefs of the Unbelievers among his people said: "We see (in) thee nothing but a man like ourselves: Nor do we see that any follow thee but the meanest among us, in judgment immature: Nor do we see in you (all) any merit above us: in fact we thing ye are liars!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="28"><![CDATA[He said: "O my people! See ye if (it be that) I have a Clear Sign from my Lord, and that He hath sent Mercy unto me from His own presence, but that the Mercy hath been obscured from your sight? shall we compel you to accept it when ye are averse to it?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="29"><![CDATA["And O my people! I ask you for no wealth in return: my reward is from none but Allah: But I will not drive away (in contempt) those who believe: for verily they are to meet their Lord, and ye I see are the ignorant ones!]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="31"><![CDATA["I tell you not that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor do I know what is hidden, nor claim I to be an angel. Nor yet do I say, of those whom your eyes do despise that Allah will not grant them (all) that is good: Allah knoweth best what is in their souls: I should, if I did, indeed be a wrong-doer."]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="32"><![CDATA[They said: "O Noah! thou hast disputed with us, and (much) hast thou prolonged the dispute with us: now bring upon us what thou threatenest us with, if thou speakest the truth!?"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="33"><![CDATA[He said: "Truly, Allah will bring it on you if He wills,- and then, ye will not be able to frustrate it!]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="37"><![CDATA["But construct an Ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration, and address Me no (further) on behalf of those who are in sin: for they are about to be overwhelmed (in the Flood)."]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="38"><![CDATA[Forthwith he (starts) constructing the Ark: Every time that the chiefs of his people passed by him, they threw ridicule on him. He said: "If ye ridicule us now, we (in our turn) can look down on you with ridicule likewise!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="39"><![CDATA["But soon will ye know who it is on whom will descend a penalty that will cover them with shame,- on whom will be unloosed a penalty lasting:"]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="41"><![CDATA[So he said: "Embark ye on the Ark, In the name of Allah, whether it move or be at rest! For my Lord is, be sure, Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="42"><![CDATA[So the Ark floated with them on the waves (towering) like mountains, and Noah called out to his son, who had separated himself (from the rest): "O my son! embark with us, and be not with the unbelievers!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="43"><![CDATA[The son replied: "I will betake myself to some mountain: it will save me from the water."

	<Verse VerseID="44"><![CDATA[Then the word went forth: "O earth! swallow up thy water, and O sky! Withhold (thy rain)!" and the water abated, and the matter was ended. The Ark rested on Mount Judi, and the word went forth: "Away with those who do wrong!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="45"><![CDATA[And Noah called upon his Lord, and said: "O my Lord! surely my son is of my family! and Thy promise is true, and Thou art the justest of Judges!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="46"><![CDATA[He said: "O Noah! He is not of thy family: For his conduct is unrighteous. So ask not of Me that of which thou hast no knowledge! I give thee counsel, lest thou act like the ignorant!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="47"><![CDATA[Noah said: "O my Lord! I do seek refuge with Thee, lest I ask Thee for that of which I have no knowledge. And unless thou forgive me and have Mercy on me, I should indeed be lost!"]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="49"><![CDATA[Such are some of the stories of the unseen, which We have revealed unto thee: before this, neither thou nor thy people knew them. So persevere patiently: for the End is for those who are righteous.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="50"><![CDATA[To the ´Ad People (We sent) Hud, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! worship Allah! ye have no other god but Him. (Your other gods) ye do nothing but invent!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="51"><![CDATA["O my people! I ask of you no reward for this (Message). My reward is from none but Him who created me: Will ye not then understand?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="52"><![CDATA["And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him (in repentance): He will send you the skies pouring abundant rain, and add strength to your strength: so turn ye not back in sin!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="53"><![CDATA[They said: "O Hud! No Clear (Sign) that hast thou brought us, and we are not the ones to desert our gods on thy word! Nor shall we believe in thee!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="54"><![CDATA["We say nothing but that (perhaps) some of our gods may have seized thee with imbecility." He said: "I call Allah to witness, and do ye bear witness, that I am free from the sin of ascribing, to Him,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="55"><![CDATA["Other gods as partners! so scheme (your worst) against me, all of you, and give me no respite.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="56"><![CDATA["I put my trust in Allah, My Lord and your Lord! There is not a moving creature, but He hath grasp of its fore-lock. Verily, it is my Lord that is on a straight Path.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="57"><![CDATA["If ye turn away,- I (at least) have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you. My Lord will make another people to succeed you, and you will not harm Him in the least. For my Lord hath care and watch over all things."]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="58"><![CDATA[So when Our decree issued, We saved Hud and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Ourselves: We saved them from a severe penalty.]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="60"><![CDATA[And they were pursued by a Curse in this life,- and on the Day of Judgment. Ah! Behold! for the ´Ad rejected their Lord and Cherisher! Ah! Behold! removed (from sight) were ´Ad the people of Hud!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="61"><![CDATA[To the Thamud People (We sent) Salih, one of their own brethren. He said: "O my people! Worship Allah: ye have no other god but Him. It is He Who hath produced you from the earth and settled you therein: then ask forgiveness of Him, and turn to Him (in repentance): for my Lord is (always) near, ready to answer."]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="62"><![CDATA[They said: "O Salih! thou hast been of us! a centre of our hopes hitherto! dost thou (now) forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshipped? But we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which thou invitest us."]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="63"><![CDATA[He said: "O my people! do ye see? if I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord and He hath sent Mercy unto me from Himself,- who then can help me against Allah if I were to disobey Him? What then would ye add to my (portion) but perdition?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="64"><![CDATA["And O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a symbol to you: leave her to feed on Allah´s (free) earth, and inflict no harm on her, or a swift penalty will seize you!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="65"><![CDATA[But they did ham-string her. So he said: "Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days: (Then will be your ruin): (Behold) there a promise not to be belied!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="66"><![CDATA[When Our Decree issued, We saved Salih and those who believed with him, by (special) Grace from Ourselves - and from the Ignominy of that day. For thy Lord - He is the Strong One, and able to enforce His Will.]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="73"><![CDATA[They said: "Dost thou wonder at Allah´s decree? The grace of Allah and His blessings on you, o ye people of the house! for He is indeed worthy of all praise, full of all glory!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="74"><![CDATA[When fear had passed from (the mind of) Abraham and the glad tidings had reached him, he began to plead with us for Lut´s people.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="75"><![CDATA[For Abraham was, without doubt, forbearing (of faults), compassionate, and given to look to Allah.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="76"><![CDATA[O Abraham! Seek not this. The decree of thy Lord hath gone forth: for them there cometh a penalty that cannot be turned back!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="77"><![CDATA[When Our messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on their account and felt himself powerless (to protect) them. He said: "This is a distressful day."]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="78"><![CDATA[And his people came rushing towards him, and they had been long in the habit of practising abominations. He said: "O my people! Here are my daughters: they are purer for you (if ye marry)! Now fear Allah, and cover me not with shame about my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man?"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="79"><![CDATA[They said: "Well dost thou know we have no need of thy daughters: indeed thou knowest quite well what we want!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="80"><![CDATA[He said: "Would that I had power to suppress you or that I could betake myself to some powerful support."]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="81"><![CDATA[(The Messengers) said: "O Lut! We are Messengers from thy Lord! By no means shall they reach thee! now travel with thy family while yet a part of the night remains, and let not any of you look back: but thy wife (will remain behind): To her will happen what happens to the people. Morning is their time appointed: Is not the morning nigh?"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="82"><![CDATA[When Our Decree issued, We turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer,-]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="84"><![CDATA[To the Madyan People (We sent) Shu´aib, one of their own brethren: he said: "O my people! worship Allah: Ye have no other god but Him.

	<Verse VerseID="87"><![CDATA[They said: "O Shu´aib! Does thy (religion of) prayer command thee that we leave off the worship which our fathers practised, or that we leave off doing what we like with our property? truly, thou art the one that forbeareth with faults and is right-minded!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="88"><![CDATA[He said: "O my people! see ye whether I have a Clear (Sign) from my Lord, and He hath given me sustenance (pure and) good as from Himself?
