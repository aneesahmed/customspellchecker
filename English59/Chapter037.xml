	<Verse VerseID="80"><![CDATA[Thus indeed do we reward those who do right.]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="82"><![CDATA[Then the rest we overwhelmed in the Flood.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="83"><![CDATA[Verily among those who followed his Way was Abraham.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="84"><![CDATA[Behold! he approached his Lord with a sound heart.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="85"><![CDATA[Behold! he said to his father and to his people, "What is that which ye worship?]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="89"><![CDATA[And he said, "I am indeed sick (at heart)!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="90"><![CDATA[So they turned away from him, and departed.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="91"><![CDATA[Then did he turn to their gods and said, "will ye not eat (of the offerings before you)?...]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="92"><![CDATA["What is the matter with you that ye speak not (intelligently)?"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="93"><![CDATA[Then did he turn upon them, striking (them) with the right hand.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="94"><![CDATA[Then came (the worshippers) with hurried steps, and faced (him).]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="95"><![CDATA[He said: "Worship ye that which ye have (yourselves) carved?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="96"><![CDATA["But Allah has created you and your handwork!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="97"><![CDATA[They said, "Build him a furnace, and throw him into the blazing fire!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="98"><![CDATA[(This failing), they then sought a stratagem against him, but We made them the ones most humiliated!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="99"><![CDATA[He said: "I will go to my Lord! He will surely guide me!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="100"><![CDATA["O my Lord! Grant me a righteous (son)!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="101"><![CDATA[So We gave him the good news of a boy ready to suffer and forbear.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="102"><![CDATA[Then, when (the son) reached (the age of) (serious) work with him, he said: "O my son! I see in vision that I offer thee in sacrifice: Now see what is thy view!" (The son) said: "O my father! Do as thou art commanded: thou will find me, if Allah so wills one practising Patience and Constancy!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="103"><![CDATA[So when they had both submitted their wills (to Allah), and he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (for sacrifice),]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="104"><![CDATA[We called out to him "O Abraham!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="105"><![CDATA["Thou hast already fulfilled the vision!" - thus indeed do We reward those who do right.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="106"><![CDATA[For this was obviously a trial-]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="107"><![CDATA[And We ransomed him with a momentous sacrifice:]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="109"><![CDATA["Peace and salutation to Abraham!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="110"><![CDATA[Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="111"><![CDATA[For he was one of our believing Servants.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="112"><![CDATA[And We gave him the good news of Isaac - a prophet,- one of the Righteous.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="113"><![CDATA[We blessed him and Isaac: but of their progeny are (some) that do right, and (some) that obviously do wrong, to their own souls.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="114"><![CDATA[Again (of old) We bestowed Our favour on Moses and Aaron,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="115"><![CDATA[And We delivered them and their people from (their) Great Calamity;]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="116"><![CDATA[And We helped them, so they overcame (their troubles);]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="117"><![CDATA[And We gave them the Book which helps to make things clear;]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="120"><![CDATA["Peace and salutation to Moses and Aaron!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="121"><![CDATA[Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="122"><![CDATA[For they were two of our believing Servants.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="123"><![CDATA[So also was Elias among those sent (by Us).]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="124"><![CDATA[Behold, he said to his people, "Will ye not fear (Allah)?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="125"><![CDATA["Will ye call upon Baal and forsake the Best of Creators,-]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="126"><![CDATA["Allah, your Lord and Cherisher and the Lord and Cherisher of your fathers of old?"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="127"><![CDATA[But they rejected him, and they will certainly be called up (for punishment),-]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="128"><![CDATA[Except the sincere and devoted Servants of Allah (among them).]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="129"><![CDATA[And We left (this blessing) for him among generations (to come) in later times:]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="130"><![CDATA["Peace and salutation to such as Elias!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="131"><![CDATA[Thus indeed do We reward those who do right.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="132"><![CDATA[For he was one of our believing Servants.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="133"><![CDATA[So also was Lut among those sent (by Us).]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="134"><![CDATA[Behold, We delivered him and his adherents, all]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="135"><![CDATA[Except an old woman who was among those who lagged behind:]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="136"><![CDATA[Then We destroyed the rest.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="137"><![CDATA[Verily, ye pass by their (sites), by day-]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="138"><![CDATA[And by night: will ye not understand?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="139"><![CDATA[So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="140"><![CDATA[When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="141"><![CDATA[He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned:]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="142"><![CDATA[Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="143"><![CDATA[Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="144"><![CDATA[He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day of Resurrection.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="145"><![CDATA[But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="146"><![CDATA[And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="147"><![CDATA[And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="148"><![CDATA[And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="149"><![CDATA[Now ask them their opinion: Is it that thy Lord has (only) daughters, and they have sons?-]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="150"><![CDATA[Or that We created the angels female, and they are witnesses (thereto)?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="151"><![CDATA[Is it not that they say, from their own invention,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="152"><![CDATA["Allah has begotten children"? but they are liars!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="153"><![CDATA[Did He (then) choose daughters rather than sons?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="154"><![CDATA[What is the matter with you? How judge ye?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="155"><![CDATA[Will ye not then receive admonition?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="156"><![CDATA[Or have ye an authority manifest?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="157"><![CDATA[Then bring ye your Book (of authority) if ye be truthful!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="158"><![CDATA[And they have invented a blood-relationship between Him and the Jinns: but the Jinns know (quite well) that they have indeed to appear (before his Judgment-Seat)!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="159"><![CDATA[Glory to Allah! (He is free) from the things they ascribe (to Him)!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="160"><![CDATA[Not (so do) the Servants of Allah, sincere and devoted.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="161"><![CDATA[For, verily, neither ye nor those ye worship-]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="162"><![CDATA[Can lead (any) into temptation concerning Allah,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="163"><![CDATA[Except such as are (themselves) going to the blazing Fire!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="164"><![CDATA[(Those ranged in ranks say): "Not one of us but has a place appointed;]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="165"><![CDATA["And we are verily ranged in ranks (for service);]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="166"><![CDATA["And we are verily those who declare (Allah´s) glory!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="167"><![CDATA[And there were those who said,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="168"><![CDATA["If only we had had before us a Message from those of old,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="169"><![CDATA["We should certainly have been Servants of Allah, sincere (and devoted)!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="170"><![CDATA[But (now that the Qur´an has come), they reject it: But soon will they know!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="171"><![CDATA[Already has Our Word been passed before (this) to our Servants sent (by Us),]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="172"><![CDATA[That they would certainly be assisted,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="173"><![CDATA[And that Our forces,- they surely must conquer.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="174"><![CDATA[So turn thou away from them for a little while,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="175"><![CDATA[And watch them (how they fare), and they soon shall see (how thou farest)!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="176"><![CDATA[Do they wish (indeed) to hurry on our Punishment?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="177"><![CDATA[But when it descends into the open space before them, evil will be the morning for those who were warned (and heeded not)!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="178"><![CDATA[So turn thou away from them for a little while,]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="179"><![CDATA[And watch (how they fare) and they soon shall see (how thou farest)!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="180"><![CDATA[Glory to thy Lord, the Lord of Honour and Power! (He is free) from what they ascribe (to Him)!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="181"><![CDATA[And Peace on the messengers!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="182"><![CDATA[And Praise to Allah, the Lord and Cherisher of the Worlds.]]></Verse>
