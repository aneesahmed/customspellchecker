	<Verse VerseID="2"><![CDATA[Is it a matter of wonderment to men that We have sent Our inspiration to a man from among themselves?- that he should warn mankind (of their danger), and give the good news to the Believers that they have before their Lord the lofty rank of truth. (But) say the Unbelievers: "This is indeed an evident sorcerer!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="3"><![CDATA[Verily your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, and is firmly established on the throne (of authority), regulating and governing all things. No intercessor (can plead with Him) except after His leave (hath been obtained). This is Allah your Lord; Him therefore serve ye: will ye not receive admonition?]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="4"><![CDATA[To Him will be your return- of all of you. The promise of Allah is true and sure. It is He Who beginneth the process of creation, and repeateth it, that He may reward with justice those who believe and work righteousness; but those who reject Him will have draughts of boiling fluids, and a penalty grievous, because they did reject Him.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="5"><![CDATA[It is He Who made the sun to be a shining glory and the moon to be a light (of beauty), and measured out stages for her; that ye might know the number of years and the count (of time). Nowise did Allah create this but in truth and righteousness. (Thus) doth He explain His Signs in detail, for those who understand.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="6"><![CDATA[Verily, in the alternation of the night and the day, and in all that Allah hath created, in the heavens and the earth, are signs for those who fear Him.]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="9"><![CDATA[Those who believe, and work righteousness,- their Lord will guide them because of their faith: beneath them will flow rivers in gardens of bliss.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="10"><![CDATA[(This will be) their cry therein: "Glory to Thee, O Allah!" And "Peace" will be their greeting therein! and the close of their cry will be: "Praise be to Allah, the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="11"><![CDATA[If Allah were to hasten for men the ill (they have earned) as they would fain hasten on the good,- then would their respite be settled at once. But We leave those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, in their trespasses, wandering in distraction to and fro.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="12"><![CDATA[When trouble toucheth a man, He crieth unto Us (in all postures)- lying down on his side, or sitting, or standing. But when We have solved his trouble, he passeth on his way as if he had never cried to Us for a trouble that touched him! thus do the deeds of transgressors seem fair in their eyes!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="13"><![CDATA[Generations before you We destroyed when they did wrong: their messengers came to them with clear-signs, but they would not believe! thus do We requite those who sin!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="14"><![CDATA[Then We made you heirs in the land after them, to see how ye would behave!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="15"><![CDATA[But when Our Clear Signs are rehearsed unto them, those who rest not their hope on their meeting with Us, Say: "Bring us a reading other than this, or change this," Say: "It is not for me, of my own accord, to change it: I follow naught but what is revealed unto me: if I were to disobey my Lord, I should myself fear the penalty of a Great Day (to come)."]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="16"><![CDATA[Say: "If Allah had so willed, I should not have rehearsed it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. A whole life-time before this have I tarried amongst you: will ye not then understand?"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="17"><![CDATA[Who doth more wrong than such as forge a lie against Allah, or deny His Signs? But never will prosper those who sin.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="18"><![CDATA[They serve, besides Allah, things that hurt them not nor profit them, and they say: "These are our intercessors with Allah." Say: "Do ye indeed inform Allah of something He knows not, in the heavens or on earth?- Glory to Him! and far is He above the partners they ascribe (to Him)!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="19"><![CDATA[Mankind was but one nation, but differed (later). Had it not been for a word that went forth before from thy Lord, their differences would have been settled between them.]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="22"><![CDATA[He it is Who enableth you to traverse through land and sea; so that ye even board ships;- they sail with them with a favourable wind, and they rejoice thereat; then comes a stormy wind and the waves come to them from all sides, and they think they are being overwhelmed: they cry unto Allah, sincerely offering (their) duty unto Him saying, "If thou dost deliver us from this, we shall truly show our gratitude!"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="23"><![CDATA[But when he delivereth them, behold! they transgress insolently through the earth in defiance of right! O mankind! your insolence is against your own souls,- an enjoyment of the life of the present: in the end, to Us is your return, and We shall show you the truth of all that ye did.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="24"><![CDATA[The likeness of the life of the present is as the rain which We send down from the skies: by its mingling arises the produce of the earth- which provides food for men and animals: (It grows) till the earth is clad with its golden ornaments and is decked out (in beauty): the people to whom it belongs think they have all powers of disposal over it: There reaches it Our command by night or by day, and We make it like a harvest clean-mown, as if it had not flourished only the day before! thus do We explain the Signs in detail for those who reflect.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="25"><![CDATA[But Allah doth call to the Home of Peace: He doth guide whom He pleaseth to a way that is straight.]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="27"><![CDATA[But those who have earned evil will have a reward of like evil: ignominy will cover their (faces): No defender will they have from (the wrath of) Allah: Their faces will be covered, as it were, with pieces from the depth of the darkness of night: they are companions of the Fire: they will abide therein (for aye)!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="28"><![CDATA[One day shall We gather them all together. Then shall We say to those who joined gods (with Us): "To your place! ye and those ye joined as ´partners´ We shall separate them, and their "Partners" shall say: "It was not us that ye worshipped!]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="30"><![CDATA[There will every soul prove (the fruits of) the deeds it sent before: they will be brought back to Allah their rightful Lord, and their invented falsehoods will leave them in the lurch.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="31"><![CDATA[Say: "Who is it that sustains you (in life) from the sky and from the earth? or who is it that has power over hearing and sight? And who is it that brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living? and who is it that rules and regulates all affairs?" They will soon say, "Allah". Say, "will ye not then show piety (to Him)?"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="32"><![CDATA[Such is Allah, your real Cherisher and Sustainer: apart from truth, what (remains) but error? How then are ye turned away?]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="37"><![CDATA[This Qur´an is not such as can be produced by other than Allah; on the contrary it is a confirmation of (revelations) that went before it, and a fuller explanation of the Book - wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord of the worlds.]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="45"><![CDATA[One day He will gather them together: (It will be) as if they had tarried but an hour of a day: they will recognise each other: assuredly those will be lost who denied the meeting with Allah and refused to receive true guidance.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="46"><![CDATA[Whether We show thee (realised in thy life-time) some part of what We promise them,- or We take thy soul (to Our Mercy) (Before that),- in any case, to Us is their return: ultimately Allah is witness, to all that they do.]]></Verse>
