	<Verse VerseID="9"><![CDATA[See they not what is before them and behind them, of the sky and the earth? If We wished, We could cause the earth to swallow them up, or cause a piece of the sky to fall upon them. Verily in this is a Sign for every devotee that turns to Allah (in repentance).]]></Verse>

	<Verse VerseID="22"><![CDATA[Say: "Call upon other (gods) whom ye fancy, besides Allah: They have no power,- not the weight of an atom,- in the heavens or on earth: No (sort of) share have they therein, nor is any of them a helper to Allah.]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="23"><![CDATA["No intercession can avail in His Presence, except for those for whom He has granted permission.
