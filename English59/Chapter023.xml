	<Verse VerseID="115"><![CDATA["Did ye then think that We had created you in jest, and that ye would not be brought back to Us (for account)?"]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="116"><![CDATA[Therefore exalted be Allah, the King, the Reality: there is no god but He, the Lord of the Throne of Honour!]]></Verse>
	<Verse VerseID="117"><![CDATA[If anyone invokes, besides Allah, Any other god, he has no authority therefor; and his reckoning will be only with his Lord! and verily the Unbelievers will fail to win through!]]></Verse>
